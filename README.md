### What this app does:
This lightweight desktop app takes your audio tracks (MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, etc.) and pairs them with a still image (JPG, PNG, BMP) to create professional, YouTube-ready MP4 videos at full HD (1920×1080). No more fiddling with confusing command-line tools or waiting for YouTube to process your uploads — this tool does all the heavy lifting for you, instantly.
